title: "how to randomly distribute exactly n events among exactly m bins"

Trival example: suppose you have a time series for new cases of an infectious diseases. We observe the following:

week|cases
--|--
1|3
2|0
3|1

To create random versions of this time series we respect the constraints of 3 weeks in total and 4 events in total. There are many randomizations that respect this, e.g.

week|cases
--|--
1|2
2|2
3|0

But how can we automate the redistribution of cases among weeks?

## Method 1


```{r}
n.weeks<-3
n.events<-5
hist(sample(1:n.weeks,n.events,replace=T),breaks=seq(0.5,n.weeks+0.5,1),plot=F)$counts
```
